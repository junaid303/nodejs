Rest (Respresentational state transefer) API
-> its a API Standard protocol or rule
lets say we met someone new, we could have communicate with him via email or whatsapp, but we choose email to have 
standard conversation, we cannot go directly Yo , hi , we have rule to , same like for web applicationos
we got REST its a API Standard Protocol
--> it is stateless (indepedent, doesn)

--> HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

CRUD - (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE)
we had simple fs , CRUD is just that, create is writeFile, read is readFile, update is appendFile, Delete is unlinkFile
So CRUD is bunch operations done on files
So if you perform CRUD operations over a network lets say readFile using GET , writeFile using POST , is called CRUD 
so in simple words CRUD over network is REST 

basically REST has clent and server , but CRUD is just you 
i have given you some data.json file , and you guys sitting somewhere else and are able to access it, i can stop it 
anytime by closing the server, i can add restrictions to it some password, all using JAVASCRIPT that is REST 

NOTE : The process of testing your own API is called pen testing 

NOTE : don't say i perform crud app , if we're using own browser for storage , then that is crud app, 
crud app means there is no network
